Pull Requests for Swag
----------------------
We love pull requests, so to encourage more of them we are offering
awesome swag. Only SIGNIFICANT pull requests count. Fixing a comma
doesnâ€™t count, but fixing a bug, adding more test coverage, or writing
guides & documentation does.

- Make 1x pull requests to get into the contributors list and website
- Make 2x pull requests, we will send you a packet of stickers
- Make 5x pull requests, and we will send you a t-shirt and more stickers
- Make 10x pull requests, and you get a job interview with James + other swag

If we miss a milestones (probably because we are working hard), just let
us know so we can get you your swag. 

Style Guide

We adhere to
[Felix's Node.js Style Guide](https://github.com/felixge/node-style-guide).
